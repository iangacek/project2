# cleanHouse Chore-ganizer

This is a Node.js application that utilizes a MongoDB back-end to look up and save household chores for multiple tenants in a home.

## Overview

The cleanHouse application was created to assist in streamlining chore responsibilities for households with multiple tenants or family members. cleanHouse utilizes a mySQL backend database to store users, days, and chores for a specific household.

## Organization

cleanHouse primarily runs from the `index.js` jQuery file located in the `js` folder. It is supported by jQuery models in `models`, API routes in `routes`, and the express.js server in `server.js`.
